# Agent Usage Guidelines

## 🔥 CRITICAL RULE: ALWAYS WRITE COMMAND OUTPUT TO FILES

### ⚠️ MANDATORY for ALL commands with potentially long output:
- **NEVER** run commands directly that might produce more than a few lines
- **ALWAYS** redirect output to files: `command > output.txt 2>&1`
- **ALWAYS** use files for post-exec grepping and re-analysis

### ❌ DO NOT Use Agent Tool For:
- Long search operations that might produce extensive output
- Complex analysis that could generate large results
- Any operation where the output might be truncated or overwhelming

### ✅ Instead, Use Direct Tools:
- **Bash tool**: Write command output to files for later analysis
- **Grep tool**: For targeted searches
- **Read tool**: For examining specific files
- **Glob tool**: For finding files by pattern

## Best Practices

### For Long Command Output:
```bash
# Instead of running commands that produce long output directly
command_with_long_output > analysis_results.txt 2>&1

# Then read the file
# Use Read tool to examine analysis_results.txt
```

### For Comprehensive Searches:
```bash
# Write search results to files
grep -r "pattern" . > search_results.txt 2>&1
find . -name "*.nix" -exec grep -l "problematic_package" {} \; > problematic_files.txt
```

### For Build Traces:
```bash
# Capture build traces to files for analysis
nix build .#config --show-trace > build_trace.txt 2>&1
```

## Example Workflow:
1. Run command and redirect output to file
2. Use Read tool to examine the file
3. Extract specific information needed
4. Continue with targeted approach

This prevents:
- Truncated outputs
- Overwhelming the conversation
- Loss of important information
- Need to repeat expensive operations
