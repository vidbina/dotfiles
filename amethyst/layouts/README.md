# Amethyst Custom Layouts

This directory contains [custom layouts](https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst/blob/development/docs/custom-layouts.md) for the Amethyst window manager. Each layout is defined in a separate JavaScript file.

## Usage

Copy or symlink some of these files into `~/Library/Application Support/Amethyst/Layouts` in order to use them in your setup.

## Layouts

- `three-frames.js`: This layout splits the screen into three frames. The first window takes up half the screen, and the remaining windows are arranged in the other half.
