* Emacs Configuration
  
Definitely not an Emacs distro but a somewhat wieldable Emacs config.

** Setup

*** Languages or Language-based Tooling

Populate a =lang.el= file which defines all of the major-modes and language-related tooling that are relevant to you. In my case I have simply defined a symlink from [[file:lang.example.el][lang.example.el]] to lang.el. YMFV!
